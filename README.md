This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This application uses python 3.8 which you can download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

All python packages you need can be found in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
Before running the bot you must install these as so:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
``` 


### Environment Variables

Before running the bot you will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of this project. A template for this can be found here:

```python
# Discord Bot
DISCORD_TOKEN = AdiSc0RdT0k3N # A discord Token taken from the discord developers portal 
BOT_OWNER = 123456789 # A discord ID for the person who should have access to owner commands


# Twitch Alert
TWITCH_TOKEN = tw1tch70k3n # Twitch Token taken from the twitch developers portal
TWITCH_SECRET = tw1tch53cr3t # Twitch Secret taken from the twitch developers portal
```

## Running the tests

Due to the incompatibility of the `discord.py 1.4` with our testing library `dpytest` you will need to download an
older version of discord.py for testing.
```
pip3 install dpytest==0.0.20
pip3 install discord.py==1.3.4
```

Tests are run using `pytest`
```
python3 -m pytest tests/
```
